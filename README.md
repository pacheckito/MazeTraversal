# MazeTraversal

Welcome to my Path Finding Algorithm repository! In this project, I have implemented two versions of a path finding algorithm for finding a path through a square maze - one using a stack and the other using a queue.

To start the program, simply input the filename of the maze description as a command line argument (e.g. java PathFinder maze1.txt). The program will print the maze to stdout, then attempt to find a path through the maze starting from the entrance and finishing at the exit, avoiding any internal walls.

If a path is found, the positions in the path will be printed to stdout along with a success message. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed. The program will print the paths that result from executing both implementations of the path finding algorithm.

I have utilized links to store and construct paths in my implementation. This project is a great practice exercise for using queues and stacks. Thanks for checking it out!
